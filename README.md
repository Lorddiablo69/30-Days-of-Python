#🔥 30 Days of Python — My Coding Journey

Welcome to my 30 Days Python Challenge!
This repo is where I document everything I learn — one day at a time — to build consistency, better fundamentals, and real dev confidence.
I’m doing this challenge to:

  Stop overthinking and start building

  Get solid with Python 

  level up daily

  create projects I can proudly show in my portfolio

Let’s go. 🚀

📅 Challenge Breakdown

  Each day includes:
    🧠 Concept of the Day
    ✍️ Notes / Practice
    🧩 Mini Project or Exercise


🎯 Goals

  Build a strong Python foundation

  Be comfortable writing code without tutorials

  Make small but meaningful projects each day

  Build consistency (no skipping!)

  Prep myself for Django, backend dev & full-stack work

✨ What I’m Using

  Python
  VS Code
  Git & GitHub
  Google/YouTube when my brain refuses to cooperate 😭

🚀 End Goal

  After 30 days, I want to look back and say:
    “Damn… I actually improved. I can build things now.”
    This challenge is my step toward becoming a proper developer — one line of code at a time.

📌 Updates

I’ll keep committing every day.
One day = one folder = one step closer.

Stay tuned. More coming. 💙🐍
